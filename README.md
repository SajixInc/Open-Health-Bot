**Why we created Open Health Bot?**
        
Open Health Bot has been envisioned to make healthcare information more accessable in most user friendly way. 

**-  Accessibility:** Open Health Bots provide a convenient way for people to access healthcare information and support from their homes, workplaces or on-the-go.

**- Affordability:** Open Health Bots has been kept open and free where people can have access to Healthcare Services and Information, making it affordable.

**- Efficiency:** Open Health Bots can quickly provide users with basic health information and guidance, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary and unauthenticated data on the web.

**- Privacy:** Open Health Bots allow users to obtain healthcare information without sharing their personal information or identity. However to keep it spam free and clean, user need to authenticate as a human. Any demographic information which has been aksed by the OHB is anonymous and required to provide relatively near to accurate information.

**- Personalization:** Open Health Bots can be programmed to provide personalized recommendations and support based on the user's specific health concerns and needs.

Overall, open health bots provide an innovative and effective way to deliver healthcare information and contributes to UNSDG's#3
